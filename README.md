# Welcome to Section Seeker!

#### **This notebook and package has been adapted from ThinkOnward's [Reflection Connection Challenge](https://thinkonward.com/app/c/challenges/reflection-connection), which ran in late 2023. The SectionSeeker can be used to train a SiameseNN to identify similar sections to the one a user inputs. This can be extremely useful for seismic interpreters looking for an analog section or basin.**
